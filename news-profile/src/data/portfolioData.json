      "More": "Beyond coding, I'm an avid adventurer; my hobbies include long-distance bicyclingâ€”having biked from Toronto to Niagara Falls over five times and completing a 1100km journey around Georgian Bay. I also enjoy long runs, hikes, and engaging in strategic games like Warhammer, which enrich my perspective and creativity \n\n My journey into coding started during my high school days in robotics. Despite embarking on thrilling road adventures and exploring various opportunities, the persistent urge to code never left me. Now, I'm back in the world of coding, continuously learning and growing. I come from a Java background and am currently diving into Spring Boot to expand my full-stack development skills. Combining my experiences and expertise, I'm dedicated to creating innovative solutions that push boundaries.",
